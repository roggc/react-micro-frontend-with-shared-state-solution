# micro-frontend with shared state example using react-context-slices

This project is a micro-fronted solution example with shared state among the micro-frontend projects and also with local shared state within each micro-frontend project, using react-context-slices in both cases, for the shared state among the micro-frontends and for the local shared state in each micro-frontend project.

With [react-context-slices](https://react-context-slices.github.io) you can define either Redux slices or React Context slices.

There is a [post](https://medium.com/@roggc9/react-webpack-module-federation-with-shared-state-micro-frontend-app-891fe7effad4) explaining step by step how to build it.
